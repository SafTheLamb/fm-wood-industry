[mod-setting-description]
wood-industry-carbon-steel=Forging steel now requires charcoal in Kilns (and carbon in Foundries). Also makes Tungsten plates require charcoal to smelt.
wood-industry-carbon-buff=Increases carbon fuel value, changes coal:carbon recipe ratios. If "Carbon steel" is enabled, also doubles steel products.
wood-industry-resin=Adds Resin, used in the production of plastic.
wood-industry-carbon-military=Replaces coal with carbon in military recipes like grenades and explosives.
wood-industry-nerf-wood-fuel=Halve fuel value for Wood, to make Charcoal's 3MJ stand out more. Also affects Woodchips and Lumber.
wood-industry-heavy-oil-adsorption=Add charcoal to various fluid recipes where it's used as a filtering agent, and also add a recipe for purifying heavy oil to petroleum gas at a higher ratio.
wood-industry-lubricant=Add charcoal to the recipes for Lubricant as a purifying agent.
wood-industry-lead=Forging Lead now requires charcoal in Kilns and Foundries.
wood-industry-tin=Solder is now smelted in Kilns (and Bronze if enabled).
wood-industry-tin-glass=Enable Glass being smelted in Kilns and Foundries, using molten tin to ensure glass is smooth.
wood-industry-titanium=Forging titanium now requires charcoal in Kilns (and carbon in Foundries).
